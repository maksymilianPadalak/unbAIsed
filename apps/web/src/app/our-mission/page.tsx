              The goal of this project is to build the best possible algorithm
              for judging corporate ethics â€” one that is fair, transparent, and
              that encourages companies to become better through real actions,
              not lobbying.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project will forever remain open source. All ideas on how to
              make the scoring algorithm better are welcome and encouraged.

              Suggestions, critiques, and data sources that should be
              incorporated are always appreciated. Together we can create a standard
